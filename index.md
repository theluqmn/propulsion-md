title: "Propulsion MD - Jekyll Theme"
description: "A Jekyll theme with elements based on Luqman's Propulsion UI SolidJS components library."
---

Propulsion MD is a Jekyl theme designed to bring the sophisticated and technical look of a modern aircraft's cockpit into your documentation, blog, or portfolio markdown-based site. The elements are based on my [Propulsion UI](https://github.com/theluqmn/propulsion-ui) SolidJS components library.

My weekly newsletter, [The Revelations](https://theluqmn.github.io/revelations/), is built using this theme.

## Features

- **Easy to use and deploy**: Simply clone the repository on your local machine and start writing your content on markdown.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Propulsion MD uses Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for animations and other visual effects.
- **Responsive design**: Your content will look great on any device.
