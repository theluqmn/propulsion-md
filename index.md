description: "A Jekyll theme with elements based on Luqman's Propulsion UI SolidJS components library."

**Designed and developed** by [Luqman](https://theluqmn.github.io)

Propulsion MD is a Jekyl theme designed to bring the sophisticated and technical look of a modern aircraft's cockpit into your documentation, blog, or portfolio markdown-based site. The elements are based on my [Propulsion UI](https://github.com/theluqmn/propulsion-ui) SolidJS components library.

My weekly newsletter, [The Revelations](https://theluqmn.github.io/revelations/), is built using this theme.
