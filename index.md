description: "A Jekyll theme with elements based on Luqman's Propulsion UI SolidJS components library."

**Designed and developed** by [Luqman](https://theluqmn.github.io)

Propulsion MD is a Jekyl theme designed to bring the sophisticated and technical look of a modern aircraft's cockpit into your documentation, blog, or portfolio markdown-based site. The elements are based on my [Propulsion UI](https://github.com/theluqmn/propulsion-ui) SolidJS components library.

My weekly newsletter, [The Revelations](https://theluqmn.github.io/revelations/), is built using this theme.

## Features

### Easy to use and deploy

Simply clone the repository on your local machine and start writing your content on markdown, then specify the layout you want to use. It's that simple.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theluqmn/propulsion-md.git
```

### Tailwind CSS

Propulsion MD uses Tailwind CSS for styling, allowing for consistent visual design across all elements.

### Responsive design

Your content will look great on any device. Propulsion MD has custom CSS styles for both horizontal and vertical screens, so we can ensure that your content is always displayed correctly.
